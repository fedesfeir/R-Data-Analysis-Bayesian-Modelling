## Data Analysis project for Bayesian Modelling
Scripts in R for data management, visualization and analysis. In this project we will analyze the College dataset that offers an opportunity to understand the educational outcomes, offering detailed data on 770 colleges and universities across the US. 
## Main steps
- Data cleaning and validation
- Descriptive statistics and visualisation (ggplot2, ggcorrplot)
- Bayesian hierarchical modelling with JAGS
- Posterior predictive checks and diagnostics

## Tools
- R, RMarkdown
- Packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `ggcorrplot`, `lme4`, `rjags`, `R2jags

## 📄 Full Report
The complete analysis is available in [project1.pdf](docs/project1.pdf).
